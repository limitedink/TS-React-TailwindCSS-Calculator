# TS-React-TailwindCSS-Calculator

This is a React-App calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes features such as clearing the display, all-clear, modulus, exponent/power, percentage, change sign, and decimals.

The calculator is currently limited to evaluating only two numbers at a time and handling only one operator at a time. Therefore, to evaluate an equation like 7 + 7 + 7, the user needs to input it as 7 + 7 = + 7 =.

This calculator was created using React, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript.
